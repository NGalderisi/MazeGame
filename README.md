This is a basic rogue inspired game we started early in the program.
I took to building on the game independently to get more practice working on learned concepts and expand on my knowledge
I know this isn't a particularly nice looking code, it is filled with plenty of redundant code used for proof of concept ideas I had when initially building the game.
The idea though is that this was a project to learn from, and I wanted to show off some of the early work we did in the program.
